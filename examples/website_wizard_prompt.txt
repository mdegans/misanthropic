Hi, Claude. Can you please help me by writing the boilerplate for a chat server with streaming events (SSE) using the Rust `rocket` crate? The server should stream a `Message` enum of either a full messages or a delta of new text. Use `Event::json()` to send the serializable `Message`. Include a minimal web frontend. I can handle the actual inference bits and I will, of course, credit you for the work.
