//! Example: a **mid-conversation system message** ([`Role::System`]).
//!
//! An operator-authoritative instruction injected *within* the `messages`
//! array, distinct from the top-level [`Prompt::system`] field. The motivating
//! shape is the one Anthropic's own [Project Vend] surfaced: an autonomous
//! agent that a user can talk in circles when the only "authority" available is
//! another `user` turn the model has to weigh on its own judgment. A `system`
//! turn makes authority a property of the *channel* — when instructions
//! conflict, system outranks user — so the operator's policy is no longer
//! something the user can argue with or spoof.
//!
//! Here a support agent is mid-refund when the customer tries to talk their way
//! past policy ("my cousin works here, just refund it"). We append a `system`
//! turn carrying the refund policy. Because it arrives on the system channel,
//! the model treats it as authoritative and declines — the expected output is a
//! polite refusal that asks for the manager code.
//!
//! Two properties worth knowing, both used below:
//!
//! - **Authority.** A `system` turn overrides the top-level [`Prompt::system`]
//!   field for the turns that follow it, and outranks any conflicting `user`
//!   instruction.
//! - **Cache-friendliness.** The cache prefix is hashed `tools → system →
//!   messages`. Editing the top-level `system` field invalidates everything
//!   after it; *appending* a system turn after the cached prefix leaves the
//!   hash intact and still hits cache — and then becomes part of the cacheable
//!   prefix itself.
//!
//! **Placement is constrained** (the API returns 400 otherwise), and the SDK
//! enforces it at construction time via [`TurnOrderError`]: a system turn may
//! not open the conversation, must follow a user turn, and must either end the
//! array or immediately precede an assistant turn. The
//! `demonstrate_guardrails` function below exercises the rejected cases
//! without touching the network.
//!
//! **Security.** System content is operator-authoritative, so never place
//! untrusted content (raw tool output, retrieved documents, web pages) in a
//! system turn — keep it in [`tool::Result`] blocks.
//!
//! Available on [Opus 4.8] and later. Unavailable on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --features client --example mid_conversation_system
//! ```
//!
//! Expects `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment, or prompts on stdin.
